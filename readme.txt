== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this different from other form plugins? =

Unlike traditional form plugins that require separate interfaces, Pluximo Form Blocks works directly in the WordPress block editor. You build forms using familiar blocks, see exactly how they'll look, and manage everything from one place.

= Where are form submissions stored? =

All submissions are stored as WordPress custom posts in your database. View them under "Form Entries" in your admin dashboard. This makes them easy to manage, export, and integrate with other WordPress tools.

= Is it secure against spam? =

Absolutely. The plugin includes IP-based rate limiting, WordPress nonce verification, and smart throttling to prevent spam and abuse. All form processing uses secure REST API endpoints.

= Can I customize validation messages? =

Yes! Each field supports custom validation messages. Set your own required field messages, character limit warnings, and pattern validation feedback.

= Does it slow down my site? =

No. The plugin only loads necessary assets and uses modern WordPress performance best practices. Forms are lightweight and built for speed.

Yes! Since submissions are stored as WordPress posts, you can use WordPress's built-in export tools or any plugin that exports custom post types.
